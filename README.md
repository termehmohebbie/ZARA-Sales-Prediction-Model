# **ZARA Sales Prediction Model**
## Overview
This project aims to predict the sales of the ZARA online store using a machine learning approach. The data used in this project was obtained from a contest held by ZARA in 2019. Due to business confidentiality, the dataset is coded and can only be accessed by registered participants. The dataset covers a period of three months and includes information on sales, stock, position on the online website, price, size, color, and other relevant features.

## Background and Dataset
ZARA is a popular fashion brand that operates both physical and online stores. The online store provides a platform for customers to browse and purchase items at their convenience. However, predicting the sales of items on the online store can be challenging due to several factors such as stock availability, price, and customer preferences. To address this challenge, ZARA held a contest in 2019 to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sales of items on their online store.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the contest and covers a period of three months. The dataset is coded due to business confidentiality and can only be accessed by registered participants. The dataset includes information on sales, stock, position on the online website, price, size, color, and other relevant features.

## Methodology
The methodology used in this project includes data transformation, feature engineering, and model training.

### Data Transformation
The data was first preprocessed to ensure that it is in a suitable format for analysis. This involved converting categorical features to numerical features, handling missing values, and removing irrelevant features.

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering was performed to extract relevant features from the dataset that can improve the performance of the model. This involved creating new features based on the existing ones, scaling and normalizing the features, and selecting the most relevant features using feature selection techniques.

### Model Training
Several machine learning models were trained on the preprocessed and engineered dataset to predict the sales of items on the ZARA online store. The models used in this project include Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

### Results
The best performing model was XGBoost Regression with a mean absolute error of 110. This model was able to predict ZARA's sales with an R-squared value of 0.81.

## Conclusion
The results obtained from this project show that machine learning models can accurately predict the sales of items on the ZARA online store. The Random Forest and XGBoost models performed best, achieving a mean squared error of 0.026 and 0.024, respectively.

## Future Work
There are several areas where this project can be improved in the future. These include:

Collecting more data on customer preferences and behavior to improve the accuracy of the model.
Exploring other machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees to determine if they can improve the performance of the model.
Deploying the model on the ZARA online store to improve the accuracy of stock management and increase customer satisfaction.
